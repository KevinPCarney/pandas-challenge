This was a particularly involved collection of work.  I took a myraid of data regarding different KPIs for a sample size of 14 schools that were either Charter Schools or District Schools.

From there, I did a number of calculations and dataframes to display the data in a manner that was easier to read.

Lastly I added two lines of observations that were noted within the data, and wrote them out in the first cell of this workbook.
