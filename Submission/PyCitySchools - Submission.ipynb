    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall Analysis: This data set was based on two CSV files of approximately 39000 students who are attending 14 different high schools.  This analysis sought to understand and visualize the relative sucess rate for these schools, first as a whole, and then displayed on a \"per school\" basis.  The KPIs that were measured involved the scores (base, average, and % of population) for math and reading.  As well as the overall success rate based on students who passed both subjects.  This data was further compared to the total budget of these schools and the per student spending.  With additional visualization used to denote whether the school was a charter school, or a district school.  Once these visualizations had occurred, I analyzed the data and drew two conclusions that I felt were relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observation 1:  There seems to be a correlation between a larger population and a decline in the overall % passing rate for the schools in this Data Set.  In 7 of the 8 schools classified as large (hereafter defined as a school whose population is > 2000), overall passing % didn't get above 55%.  Wilson Highschool is the outlier, it has a population of 2283, and has an overall passing % of 90%.  The next lowest population of the \"large\" schools is Ford Highschool.  Ford has a population of 2739 and has an overall passing %  of 54%.  This is in keeping with other schools in it's classification.  It would stand to reason that once the population surpasses 2500, a decline in overall passing % may be seen.  There is also a direct correlation between schools that are considered to be district schools vs schools that are considered charter school.  All district schools in this dataset are classified as large schools.  The only charter school that is considered large was Wilson Highschool which was shown to have test scores in line with other Charter schools as was already noted.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Observation 2: It was noted that budget seemed to have little consequence on the relative success rate of the students attending these schools.  The schools with the highest budget were the district schools, and they also had the highest per student spending.  Yet as was already noted, they were all in the bottom 5 with regards to test scores.  Meanwhile the top 5 schools were all having around 1 Million dollars, with the exception of Pena High School which is number 5 on the top 5, but only had a budget of 500 thousand.  It should be noted however, that Pena High School has the second lowest population for the entire data set.  As a result their per student spending is moderate. \n",
